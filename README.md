This project is about building an e-commerce platform for a mid-sized retail company. The main goal is to give customers a smooth and fast shopping experience, similar to what they would get on big e-commerce sites. The platform needs to handle many products, users, and transactions efficiently. It should also include features like product search, a shopping cart, and real-time stock updates.

1. Managing a large amount of data, such as products, users, and transactions.
2. Ensuring the platform is fast and responsive for users.
   Implementing real-time features like live search and stock updates.

Backend (Node.js and Express):
I’ll use MongoDB for storing product, user, and transaction data, and Redis to cache frequent searches for faster responses. The backend will include APIs for product searches, details, and real-time updates.

Frontend:
I’ll use React with Next.js for a fast, responsive UI, including live product search and real-time stock updates.

Real-time Features:

Implement live product search and stock updates so that customers can get up-to-date information as they browse.
